## Ballclipse - Game Development Progress Report - Week 2

### Introduction
Continuing from the previous week, I have made significant updates and improvements to the game, including changes to the user interface (UI), addition of score and health managers, creation of a main menu screen, and implementation of clickable buttons. These updates have enhanced the overall experience and usability of the game.

### Features

1. UI Changes
   - Added a score manager and a health manager to display the score and remaining health of the player.
   - Score Manager: Positioned in the top-right corner of the screen.
   - Health Manager: Positioned in the top-left corner of the screen.

2. Main Menu Screen
   - Created a main menu screen for the game.
   - Utilized Minecraft-styled text to write the game name, "Ballclipse," adding a unique visual touch.

3. Clickable Buttons
   - Implemented clickable buttons in the main menu screen.
   - Upon clicking a button, the player will be directed to the next instance, which is the endless runner gameplay.
